# Automated-urban-parking-management-System-using-yolov8-
This project leverages advanced computer vision techniques using YOLOv8 to detect vehicles and analyze their alignment within parking slots. The system enhances urban parking management by identifying improperly parked vehicles and providing real-time feedback for better organization and efficiency.

Key Features:

->Vehicle Detection: Real-time detection of vehicles in parking areas.
->Alignment Analysis: Evaluates vehicle alignment within designated parking slots.
->Automated Alerts: Generates feedback for misaligned vehicles.
->Scalable Design: Optimized for integration in urban parking systems.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch
Object Detection Model: YOLOv8
Visualization: Matplotlib, OpenCV
System Deployment: Scalable cloud-based storage (optional).
Feel free to use or adapt this project as a foundation for improving parking systems in urban environments.
